"Estimated mortality and morbidity attributable to smoke plumes in the US: Not just a western US problem"

Authors: Katelyn Oâ€™Dell, Kelsey Bilsback, Bonne Ford, Sheena E. Martenies, Sheryl Magzamen, 
Emily V. Fischer, and Jeffrey R. Pierce

Conda environments used to run these scripts for the analysis presented in the paper are available in this repository:
python2_smokeHIA_env.txt (environment used for codes run in python2)
python3_smokeHIA_env.txt (environment used for codes run in python3)

In order to perform the analysis presented in the paper, 
these codes are run in the following order:

Stage 1: Prep Input Datasets
(1.1) regrid_population.py
	This code was adapted from a regrid.py code from Dr. Kelsey Bilsback, and is run in python 2.
	It requires the kriging grid which is available for download at: https://doi.org/10.25675/10217/230602
	and the SEDAC gridded population of the world v4, available at: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11

(1.2) mk_state_grid.py
	Python script to assign grid cells to states. Was done by hand, but may be faster to
	just grab a higher resolution shapefile in the future.
	Requires population output from (1.1) to check state assignments

(1.3) prep_smokePM_4HIA.py
	This code loads all years of the PM data, calculates smoke PM, and saves as a netCDF 
	of the combined total PM, smoke PM, and HMS to use in the following scripts.
	
	This code creates Figures 1 and S10 in the manuscript.
	
	Code requires: 
		krigged PM2.5 dataset available for download at: https://doi.org/10.25675/10217/230602
		a state mask which assigns grid cells to each state, created in step 1.2
		re-gridded SEDAC population for 2010, created in step 1.1

Stage 2: Acute Smoke PM2.5 HIA
(2.1) pool_asth_OR.py
	This code conducts a monte-carlo fixed-effect pooling of odds ratios for asthma ED
	visits and asthma hospitalizations from the US studies included in Borchers Arrigada et al.
	(2019) with additional recently published western US studies and eastern US studies. 
	This code creates Figure S3. 
	
	Code requires:
		csv file with odds ratios to pool. All of these values are available in the
		publications referenced in Figure S3.

(2.2) calc_acute_HIA_pool_EPAregions.py
	This code calculates the acute smoke PM2.5 HIA and sums by regions in the paper.
	Figures 2, 3, S1, S2, S4, and S5 are created in this code.
	
	Code requires:
		Krigged PM output from step 1.3, population output from step 1.1, state grid
		from step 1.2, and acute baseline rates available via HCUP (details in paper).
		
(2.3) calc_acute_HIA_pool_states.py
	This code calculates the acute HIA by state and creates Figures S6-S9.
	
	Code requires:
		HIA output from step 2.2, population output from step 1.1, state grid
		from step 1.2, and acute baseline rates available via HCUP (details in paper).

Stage 3: Chronic Smoke PM2.5 and Smoke HAPs HIA
(3.1) calc_mortalities_DALYs_gemm.py
	This code calculates total PM and smoke PM mortalities and smoke PM DALYs. 
	It is modified from code written by Dr.s Kelsey Bilsback and Jack Kodros. 
	
	Code requires:
		Krigged PM output from step 1.3, population output from step 1.1, and the state 
		grid from step 1.2.
		
(3.2) plot_mortalities_by_country_gemm.py
	This code creates Figure 4 in the main text. It is modified from code written by 
	Dr.s Kelsey Bilsback and Jack Kodros. 
	
	Code requires:
		Mortalities output from step 3.1, population output from step 1.1, and the state
		grid from step 1.2
	
(3.3) calc_DALYs_fromHAPs.py
	This code estimates HAPs concentrations, calculates DALYs from HAPs,
	and creates Figure 5 in the main text and Figures S11 and S12 in the supplement.
	
	Code requires:
		HAPs to PM ratios from O'Dell et al. (2020) supplementary data, 
		combined damage and effect factors from Huijbregts et al. (2005) appendix 1,
		krigged PM2.5 output from step 1.3, population file from step 1.1, state grid 
		from step 1.2, and PM DALYs from step 3.1
		
and that's a wrap!

NOTE:
# 03.32.23 - I have since realized I have a few instances in the pool_asth_OR.py code of setting pandas values with chained indexing (which is ill-advised as it may not often work as exptected). I re-looked over this code and believe the instances in which I had those issues I had confirmed the code was working as expected or the output of the code indicates it worked as expected. I also beleive the locaitons where this occurs, if it was an error, would not lead to major changes in my anlysis. However, if anyone uses this code in the future, those istances should be resolved. See here for details on this warning in pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy.
